# jahbot
A bot for my own discord server, has very limited and niche uses. 
Currently, it manages a channel called '#a' where it makes it so that no one can send a message in the channel, unless that message is the letter a.
It also has a couple of commands such as 'hello' where it says hello back. 
In order to execute a command with the bot, you need to say "jahbot <command>" 
This bot was made using Discord.NET, and is still in development. It is only available on my personal server, as it only has very specific uses, some of which are only able to be used by me or an administrator of the server. 
ike-bot is still in development, with more additions and changes occurring daily. 

MAIN FEATURES:
- rename: ability to rename everyone on the server to a specific name
- anti-spam: regulates the channel by muting people who send excessive amounts of messages (excluding itself)
- regulates a channel called '#a,' where you can only send a message that is the letter a. Otherwise, your message is automatically deleted.
- spam: can send a simple message as many times as the command specifies
- purge: deletes a certain amount of messages in the chat. 
- music: given a link, jahbot can now play any youtube video in the channel you're in! 
- cloud deployment: jahbot is now always online, using a remote server to be constantly up instead of having to run on my computer


HOW TO USE JAHBOT:
To start, each command for jahbot must start with 'jahbot.' Most of jahbot's commands are only accessible to admins and owners of the server, because they're really powerful things like renaming everyone on the server. There are many commands for jahbot (several of which are still in progress), and the easiest way to find them is to go into the code and see the commands and what they do for yourself. 


CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS:
- random commands/features; added at the discretion of creator and usually are just shortcuts for other commands.
- universalJah: currently, jahbot can only join or access servers that I am moderators of, but now that jahbot is hosted online, I'm working on making jahbot universal so that anyone can invite him to their server. 
- jahbot AI: working with the ML.NET libraries, I'm hoping to have a smart AI Chatbot for jahbot so that users can hold normal conversations with him

Note: don't add him to your server. he's too powerful
