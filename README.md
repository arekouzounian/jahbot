# jahbot
A bot for my own discord server, has very limited and niche uses. 
Currently, it manages a channel called '#a' where it makes it so that no one can send a message in the channel, unless that message is the letter a.
It also has a couple of commands such as 'hello' where it says hello back. 
In order to execute a command with the bot, you need to say "jahbot <command>" 
This bot was made using Discord.NET, and is still in development. It is only available on my personal server, as it only has very specific uses, some of which are only able to be used by me or an administrator of the server. 
ike-bot is still in development, with more additions and changes occurring daily. 

MAIN FEATURES:
- rename: ability to rename everyone on the server to a specific name
- anti-spam: regulates the channel by muting people who send excessive amounts of messages (excluding itself)
- regulates a channel called '#a,' where you can only send a message that is the letter a. Otherwise, your message is automatically deleted.
- spam: can send a simple message as many times as the command specifies
- purge: deletes a certain amount of messages in the chat. 

CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS:
- voice capabilities; the bot is able to connect to the channel but is unable to play music.
